# Sogeti Training Camp App


ASU Capstone Project developed by me and a team of five others across the final two semesters of school.  This app is a cross-platform app to be used on both Android and iOS devices. Created using the React Native framework.  

Refer to [React Native's Getting Started page](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for initial setup.  We followed [this guide](https://www.undefinednull.com/2016/04/21/debugging-react-native-apps-using-visual-studio-code/) for the React Native development environment.


Required packages:

* react-native-lock

* react-native-drawer

* react-native-navbar

* react-native-tableview-simple

* react-native-keyboard-aware-scrollview

I created an interactive mock-up of the app during the CSE485: Capstone I class using [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) which can be [found here](https://invis.io/QC91SAH6E#/196073465_Login).
